    A CS senior at Princeton passionate about technology, design, and entrepreneurship, I am excited about opportunities that allow me to apply both my technical and people skills.</br></br>
      
  This past summer I interned at Apple on the Apple News Technical Operations team, working on projects including front-end development with JavaScript, configuring web-based onboarding tools, and data analysis for drawing business insights. As the Head Web Development Editor at The Daily Princetonian, I work on web development for special news stories, visual essays, and data visualizations using HTML, CSS, and JS. I also interface with several sections, such as Tech, Data, Editorial, Photos, and Business. </br></br>
      In addition to my internship and project-based experience in software development and machine learning research as described below, I previously lead 30 students in organizing three annual conferences as Director of IgniteSTEM, a Princeton Entrepreneurship Club-affiliated organization innovating in K-12 STEM education. We organize large-scale Educator Conferences in cities like New York and Philadelphia and Design Thinking challenges for high school and middle school students.</br></br>

      <h2>ML/Data Science Intern, German Aerospace Center</h2>
      <p>
      I performed literature review on ML techniques used to detect misinformation on social media and conducted exploratory data analysis on a Twitter dataset consisting of tweets on the Russia-Ukraine conflict. I worked on a project performing account-level bot detection on Twitter, comparing two approaches - deep neural networks and the Adaboost boosting algorithm coupled with SMOTE-ENN (combining SMOTE with Edited Nearest Neighbor (ENN) to balance the dataset). I extended both methods to a new dataset and then tuned the hyperparameters to prevent overfitting, achieving an accuracy of 96% with the boosting approach.

    <h2><a href="https://startery.io/cohorts/">Summer Analyst, Startery</a></h2>
    <p>As a part-time Summer Analyst for Startery, a unique professional services firm, I worked on creating high quality deliverables, including marketing strategy and UI/UX designs, for a DeFi startup client. Through Startery's incubator program, I co-led a team of 3 working on FinLit: a gamified financial literacy app for students and educators, that won the first position on Demo Day. I led the design of our pitch deck and created <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/iUZjOH4z3qoPnMKeqFHFwU/online-learning-app?node-id=1%3A2&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1" target="blank">mockups of the app on Figma.</a>

      <h2><a href="https://github.com/AnanyaGrover1/hmeipublic" target="blank">Web Development Intern, HMEI - Princeton</a></h2>
      <p>
     As an intern in the Hurricane Modeling research group under Dr. Lin, I visualized geospatial mapping data with DataWrapper, Mapbox, and ArcGIS Pro. I built an automated real-time updating web app displaying the latest hurricane risk forecasts with the Python Flask framework, DataWrapper and Google Sheets API. This platform will eventually be released in the public domain and will be an important tool for decision-making, evacuation planning, and recovery from natural disaster, as well as long-time policy making to build coastal resilience.

    <h2><a href="https://frosh.dailyprincetonian.com/" target="blank">Frosh Issue</a></h2>
    <p>A special issue for incoming freshmen, I developed the website for the digitial edition of "the frosh issue" for Princeton's Class of 2025 mainly with HTML and CSS, with Javascript used for animations on scrolling. Using a social media feed as a starting inspiration, I used a flexbox to split the screen with articles on the left and a subscription box, embedded podcasts, cartoons and ads in the right column. I used a "sticky header" to add a banner advertisement. The 2022 version can be sorted by tags.

      <h2>iOS App Designer and Developer, Readwell</h2>
      <p>
I worked as an iOS app designer and developer using SwiftUI for a seed-funded startup called “Readwell,” a curated eBook and AudioBook reading platform for children. In this role, I researched UI/UX design and best practices for reading apps. Working in close collaboration with the Founder, I developed a prototype of the iOS mobile application over the course of a month. The prototype included features such as 2 different book display views, genre-based sorting, book profile views, ebook reading display, and an audiobook player.

    </a></h2> 
    
    <p>For this reflective story looking back at campus protests by the Black Justice League, we used a "scrollytelling" format with text captions scrolling on top of background images and video clips from the protest. I was more involved in the design-based elements such as the creative layout of the images in the beginning and arranging headlines, quote texts, etc on the page.</br></br>

      <p>For this visual essay consisting of impactful photographs with short captions, I implemented horizontal scrolling (on laptops – and vertical on narrower screens). To keep it responsive for different screen sizes, I worked on changing the formatting and styling.
