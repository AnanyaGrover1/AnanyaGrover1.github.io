    As Associate Web Design and Development Editor of the Digital News team of The Daily Princetonian, I work on web design and development for special news stories, visual essays, and data visualization using HTML, CSS, and JS. </br></br>

    In Summer 2021, I interned with Dr Ning Lin, Associate Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Princeton, building a Real-Time Forecasting System for Hurricane Hazards and Risk. More details below.</br></br>

          
       In Fall 2021, I worked as a Software Developer Intern for a student-run startup Berry, a browser extension that makes healthy eating easier for people with dietary restrictions. My role is to develop recommendation algorithms in JS. </br></br>	

        I am also a core team member of a student organization Hoagie, where I contribute towards building an ecosystem of campus apps like HoagieMail and HoagieMenus to improve student life. I am training myself in React and Go for this position. </br></br>

        In addition, as a student in Princeton’s “Service Focus” program in the Public Interest Technology track, I am working with a partner to develop a digital dashboard for an NGO called Share My Meals.

      <h2><a href="https://frosh.dailyprincetonian.com/">Frosh Issue</a></h2>
    <p>A special issue for incoming freshmen, I developed the website for the digital edition of "the frosh issue" for Princeton's Class of 2025 mainly with HTML and CSS, with Javascript used for animations on scrolling. Using a social media feed as a starting inspiration, I used a flexbox to split the screen with articles on the left and a subscription box, an embedded podcast, and an ad in the right column. I used a "sticky header" to add a banner advertisement.

    </a></h2> 
    
    <p>For this reflective story looking back at campus protests by the Black Justice League, we used a "scrollytelling" format with text captions scrolling on top of background images and video clips from the protest. I was more involved in the design-based elements such as the creative layout of the images in the beginning and arranging headlines, quote texts, etc on the page.</br></br>

      <h2><a href="https://projects.dailyprincetonian.com/princeton-photo-essay-hidden-sides-beauty/">The Hidden Sides of Princeton</a></h2>
      <p>For this visual essay consisting of impactful photographs with short captions, I implemented horizontal scrolling (on laptops – and vertical on narrower screens). To keep it responsive for different screen sizes, I worked on changing the formatting and styling.

      <h2><a href="https://github.com/AnanyaGrover1/hmeipublic"> HMEI: Dr. Lin's Research Group</a></h2>
      <p>
     As an intern in the Hurricane Modeling research group under Dr. Lin, I visualized geospatial mapping data with DataWrapper, Mapbox, and ArcGIS Pro. I built an automated real-time updating web app displaying the latest hurricane risk forecasts with the Python Flask framework, DataWrapper and Google Sheets API. This platform will eventually be released in the public domain and will be an important tool for decision-making, evacuation planning, and recovery from natural disaster, as well as long-time policy making to build coastal resilience.
